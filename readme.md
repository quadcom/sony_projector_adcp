# Sony Projector ADCP Integration for Home Assistant

This custom integration allows you to control Sony projectors (specifically the VPL-XW5000 and compatible models) using the ADCP (Advanced Display Control Protocol) over your local network.

## Features

### Core Media Player Controls
- **Power On/Off**: Standard media player power control
- **Input Selection**: Switch between HDMI 1 and HDMI 2
- **Status Monitoring**: Real-time status updates every 30 seconds

### Additional Controls via Services
All advanced controls are accessible through custom media player services:

- **Picture Adjustments**: Brightness, Contrast, Sharpness (0-100), Light Output (0-1000)
- **Picture Modes**: Cinema Film 1/2, Reference, TV, Photo, Game, Bright Cinema/TV, User 1/2/3
- **Menu Navigation**: Menu, Up, Down, Left, Right, Enter, Reset
- **Video Mute**: Blank screen function

### Important Limitations

**⚠️ Volume Control Not Supported**: The VPL-XW5000 does not support volume control commands via ADCP protocol. This is a hardware limitation of the projector model, not the integration.

## Supported Models

This integration has been developed for the Sony VPL-XW5000 but should work with other Sony projectors that support the ADCP protocol, including:

- VPL-XW5000, VPL-XW5100
- VPL-XW6000, VPL-XW6100
- VPL-XW7000
- VPL-XW8100
- VPL-VW series (check compatibility in the protocol manual)

## Installation

### HACS (Recommended)

1. Open HACS in Home Assistant
2. Click on "Integrations"
3. Click the three dots in the top right corner
4. Select "Custom repositories"
5. Add this repository URL and select "Integration" as the category
6. Click "Install"
7. Restart Home Assistant

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/sony_projector_adcp` folder to your Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory
2. If the `custom_components` directory doesn't exist, create it in the same location as your `configuration.yaml` file
3. Restart Home Assistant

## Configuration

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**
2. Click **+ Add Integration**
3. Search for "Sony Projector ADCP"
4. Enter your projector's details:
   - **IP Address**: The IP address of your projector on your network
   - **Port**: Default is 53595 (usually doesn't need to be changed)
   - **Name**: Friendly name for your projector
   - **Use Authentication**: Whether to use password authentication (default: enabled)
   - **Password**: Authentication password (default: "Projector")

### Network Setup on Projector

Ensure your projector is configured for network control:

1. On your projector, go to the menu
2. Navigate to **Installation** → **Network Settings**
3. Set **Network Management** to **ON** or set **Standby Mode** to **Standard**
4. Configure network settings (IP address, etc.)
5. Note the **Authentication Password** if authentication is enabled

## Usage

### Media Player Entity

The integration creates a single media player entity: `media_player.sony_projector`

**Standard Media Player Controls:**
- `media_player.turn_on` - Power on the projector
- `media_player.turn_off` - Power off the projector
- `media_player.select_source` - Switch input (HDMI 1 or HDMI 2)

**Attributes:**
- `source` - Current input source
- `video_muted` - Video mute status
- `picture_mode` - Current picture mode
- `brightness` - Current brightness level (0-100)
- `contrast` - Current contrast level (0-100)
- `sharpness` - Current sharpness level (0-100)
- `light_output` - Current light output level (0-1000)
- `reality_creation` - Reality Creation status ("on" or "off")

### Settings Entities

Every setting is also a real entity on the same device, so a dashboard can show dropdowns, sliders and switches with live values. Option lists and slider limits come from the projector itself (`<param> ? --range`), so they follow the current picture mode and incoming signal. An entity is unavailable while the projector is off or while the projector says the setting cannot be changed.

| Type | Entities |
|------|----------|
| Select | Picture mode, Input, Colour temperature, Colour space, Gamma, Motionflow, Contrast enhancer, Noise reduction, HDR, Aspect |
| Number | Brightness, Contrast, Sharpness, Colour, Hue, Light output |
| Switch | Reality Creation, Input lag reduction, Picture blank |
| Button | Menu, Up, Down, Left, Right, Enter, Reset |

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Connect
- Verify the projector's IP address is correct
- Ensure the projector is on the same network as Home Assistant
- Check that Network Management is enabled on the projector
- Verify the port (default 53595) is correct
- Check if a firewall is blocking the connection

### Authentication Fails
- Verify the password matches the projector's authentication password
- Check if authentication is enabled on both the projector and in the integration config
- Default password is "Projector" (case-sensitive)

### Commands Not Working
- Ensure the projector is powered on (most commands only work when on)
- Check Home Assistant logs for error messages
- Try power cycling the projector

### Values Not Updating
- The integration polls the projector every 30 seconds
- Some values may only be available when the projector is powered on
- Check network connectivity

## Debug Logging

To enable debug logging, add this to your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.sony_projector_adcp: debug
```
